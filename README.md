## What I attempted to build
https://learnappmaking.com/creating-a-simple-ios-game-with-swift-in-xcode/  
For my Hack-a-thing-1, I was interested in using Swift to create a mobile app for iOS. As I have no previous experience with Swift, I followed the above tutorial to create a simple game called Add 1. The tutorial was helpful because it provided the graphics necessary for the game so I did not have to find or design screens on my own. It also gave me all the building blocks to create a fully functional game, and then continue to expand on its basic function on my own. Throughout my code I made sure to specify what parts I had typed in from the tutorial and what parts were original code I added on later. 

## What I learned
Throughout this tutorial, I learned a lot about designing the app's UI. I thought Xcode's Interface Builder editor was very easy to use and made creating the game screens much easier. I had never actually used a UI editor before and it almost felt like using Figma, except I was able to connect actions to the design. I realized how important it is to align and constrain all the different elements on the screen so that the app will look good across different devices.  
I also learned how to use Swift and what sort of functions are feasible. Although this tutorial was pretty basic, I already started to implement some functions that used interesting logic. This gave me some ideas of other ways I could expand the functionality of this game such as increasing the timer from 1 minute to 2 minutes, decreasing by 2 seconds instead of 1 when the score is above 10 and showing a thumbs up graphic if the user got the answer right and a thumbs down one if they got it wrong.

## What didn't work
