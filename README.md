For my Hack-a-thing-1, I was interested in using Swift to create an app for iOS mobile. As I have no experience with Swift, I followed the above tutorial to create a simple game. The tutorial was helpful because it provided the graphics necessary for the game so I did not have to find or design images on my own. It also gave me all the building blocks to create a fully functional game, and then continue to expand on its basic function.
